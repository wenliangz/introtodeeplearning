The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n",

Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model. Synthetic data generation and synthetic tasks are a way to address these limitations, and this is an active area of research.\n",

The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing."

        "Opik has a base class for defining metrics, [`base_metric.BaseMetric`](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/python-sdk-reference/evaluation/metrics/BaseMetric.html). You will use this to define a custom metric that uses the judge LLM to evaluate text for how well it adheres to Yoda speak. Note that the judge LLM and the metric can be applied to any text, not just the outputs of the model. This is important to keep in mind, since we need both a negative control -- text in the \"base\" standard English style -- and a positive control -- training-set text in Yoda-speak style -- against which to compare the model's generations.\n",
